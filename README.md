# BouncingBlackSquaresUnity

Started as a recreation for PC and mobile of my micro-game Bouncing the black squares originally made with phaser, it's now going to be a completly different game... It has a different name now.

# WARNING !!!

I've done some stuff to have a proper Unity3D repositorie.
This one is kept as a souvenir !

The url of the new repositorie : https://github.com/Gilles-Lengy/UnityBouncingBlackSquares
